My experience with apps on the AppStore is hit or miss usually, so one day when I had a spare hour before we set off to play badminton with friends, I decided to create a simple score counter in SwiftUI for the player that's not currently playing to keep track with.

More and more features crept in with time like watch support, badminton rules built-in, narrated score state, and last but not least, **confetti**.
