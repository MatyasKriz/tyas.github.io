### Lifelong Student 🧑‍🎓

I've successfully finished bachelor's study program at FIT VUT Brno during which I learned quite a bit of theoretical programming. To supplement that with experience, I worked part-time at [**Brightify**](https://brightify.github.io) where I got to create new apps as well as maintain and improve small to medium-sized apps under an experienced mentor [Tadeas Kriz](https://bsky.app/profile/tadeas.bsky.social).

### iOS Developer 💻📲

After college, I worked for Brightify full-time, learning more along the way during my 5 year-long stay there. Continuing with UIKit development and eventually switching to SwiftUI + KMP. Next to client work I've dabbled with some personal projects (e.g. an incremental game, Chrome extension for meal rating, or Slack status updates about Czech COVID situation), none of them are publishable though. 😁

Starting new projects from the ground up was freeing, having no legacy baggage to carry around, but I decided to give long-term app development a go at Notino where I work on a fairly large app since January 2022. I got to join a rather small iOS team with which we care for an app with quite a technical debt that we're still paying off in some places to be honest. Even as I was rather fresh I came with new perspective into the project and thrived as a mentor and de facto staff engineer.

Currently we're transitioning the project to SwiftUI (late, but we couldn't bump iOS versions for business decisions) and we're loving every second of the streamlined development and much easier maintenance due to simpler code.

This also touches on the fact that I often come up with improvements to projects I work on, I don't insist on having it my way, but my passion is in making future features easier and cheaper to implement by saving developer time.

In my spare time I shipped multiple apps under my own belt, you can find out more on the [Apps](./../apps) page.
